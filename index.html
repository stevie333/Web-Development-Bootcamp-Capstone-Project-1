    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Stevie, I am currently working as a software engineer at Blueprint Gaming. I develop casino games using web development. I do tasks from creating full games to fixing bugs on games.
        <br><br>
        Some of the games I have developed so far are "Wonder of Ages", "Almighty Gods" and "Copped The Lot: Diamond Heist".
        <br><br>
        I am currently seconded, working on a large project for WhiteHat USA (this involves making our games at Blueprint functional for that client and updating each game where required and delivering a large amount of games to the client in a specific time period)
        <br><br>
        Whilst I am passionate about gaming and front-end web development, I am looking for an opportunity to get into general front end web development and eventually become a full-stack developer. I am currently doing new projects at home in my spare time to develop myself.
